XFS350 is a web-based 2D flight simulator game designed to be comprehensive, yet easy to use. It is a throwback to my first ever flight simulator project, XFS, which I created in 2020 using Scratch - during math class. This project is one of my submissions for the [2024/2025 High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com/) event hosted by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/).

Unlike my other technical projects, such as [737fms](https://github.com/theluqmn/737fms), this project is simpler to understand and enjoy, with in-game tutorials available to guide you through the game.
