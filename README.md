XFS350 is a web-based 2D flight simulator game designed to be comprehensive, yet easy to use. It is a throwback to my first ever flight simulator project, XFS, which I created in 2020 using Scratch - during math class. This project is one of my submissions for the [2024/2025 High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com/) event hosted by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/).

Unlike my other technical projects, such as [737fms](https://github.com/theluqmn/737fms), this project is simpler to understand and enjoy. The UI is designed from scratch to contain several elements from the real cockpit, whilst ensuring only the essentials are present and presented in a clear and concise manner. The central display - ECAM - defaults to a "general purpose display" mode (does not exist in the real aircraft) which allows users to find guides, change settings, and let the game perform automatic tasks to simplify the experience.
